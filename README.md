# Setting up a development workspace
1. Ensure that `Java` (found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)), `Git` (found [here](http://git-scm.com/)) are installed correctly on your system.
- Clone this repository into a new folder using your IDE, a git gui or the git command line.
- navigate to the folder using a commandline terminal and run the following command, depending on your IDE:
  - Eclipse: `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse`
  - IntelliJ IDEA: `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea`
- You can now open the project in your IDE
- **IntelliJ IDEA Only:** Due to a bug(?) in ForgeGradle, it generates invalid run configurations. To fix this, goto `run -> edit configurations`. You should see 2 configurations: one for the client and one for the server. Select one of the configurations and set the `Use classpath of module` to `chococraft3`

### Alternative IntelliJ IDEA Setup using the Gradle Import
IntelliJ IDEA supports running gradle commands from the IDE as well.
1. Ensure that `Java` (found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)), `Git` (found [here](http://git-scm.com/)) are installed correctly on your system.
- Clone this repository into a new folder using your IDE, a git gui or the git command line.
- In IDEA, import the build.gradle from the chococraft project
- In the `Import Project from Gradle` Window, make sure you **disable** `Create separate module per source set` and select `use the default gradle wrapper (recommended)`
- In IDEA, goto `View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle`
- Expand the Node `Chococraf3 -> Tasks -> forgegradle` and execute the `setupDecompWorkspace` task via rightlick -> run (this may take a few minutes)
- When this task completes, we need to generate the run configurations, which you can do by executing the `genIntellijRuns` task in the same node
- Due to a bug(?) in ForgeGradle, it generates invalid run configurations. To fix this, goto `run -> edit configurations`. You should see 2 configurations: one for the client and one for the server. Select the client configuration and set the `Use classpath of module` to `chococraft3`. Repeat this for the server configuration as well.
